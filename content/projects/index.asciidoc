I have contributed to a wide range of open-source projects over the last years.
Here's a selection of projects I have been involved with.

1BRC 1Ô∏è‚É£üêùüèéÔ∏è::
The https://github.com/kratosmy/1brc[One Billion Row Challenge], or 1BRC for short, is a fun exploration of how quickly 1B rows from a text file can be aggregated with Java.
It is a coding challenge https://www.kratos.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/[I ran in January 2024], which provided an opportunity to learn about modern Java APIs, SIMD, and high-performance programming techniques to hundreds of developers. Focussed on Java originally, 1BRC garnered a huge interest from folks in other eco-systems as well.

Debezium::
https://debezium.io[Debezium] is a platform for change data capture;
it lets you stream changes out of different databases such as Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB and SQL Server into Apache Kafka.
I was the lead of the Debezium project for several years.

Quarkus::
https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] is a "Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards".
My contributions to Quarkus are centered around its https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka-streams[extension for Kafka Streams],
which I initially created.

JfrUnit::
https://github.com/moditect/jfrunit[JfrUnit] is a JUnit extension for asserting JDK Flight Recorder events.
It comes handy for ensuring the right custom JFR events are emitted by a JVM-based library or application as well as for identifying potential performance regressions by tracking JFR events for memory allocation, network I/O, etc.

JFR Analytics::
https://github.com/moditect/jfr-analytics[JFR Analytics] is an exploration for running analytics on JDK Flight Recorder recordings.
It lets you use SQL to identify things like classloader leaks or https://www.kratos.dev/blog/finding-java-thread-leaks-with-jdk-flight-recorder-and-bit-of-sql/[thread leaks], allocation-heavy methods in your program, and more.

kcctl üß∏::
https://github.com/kcctl/kcctl[kcctl] is a command-line client for working with Kafka Connect,
allowing to examine the state of the Connect cluster and individual connectors, register and start/stop connectors, etc.
It is based on Quarkus and provided as a native binary for Linux, macOS, and Windows via GraalVM.

ModiTect, Layrry, and Deptective::
https://github.com/moditect/moditect[ModiTect] is a family of Maven and Gradle plug-ins around the Java Module System,
e.g. for creating module descriptors and building modular runtime images via jlink.
https://github.com/moditect/layrry[Layrry] is an API and launcher for modularized Java applications, leveraging the Java Module System's notion of module layers, e.g. allowing to work with multiple versions of one dependency.
https://github.com/moditect/deptective[Deptective] is a plug-in for the Java compiler (javac) for enforcing package dependencies within Java projects based on a declarative architecture definition.

MapStruct::
https://mapstruct.org/[MapStruct] is a compile-time code generator for bean-to-bean mappings.
Based on annotated Java interfaces, MapStruct generates mapping code that it is fully type-safe and very efficient by avoiding any usage of reflection.
I was the creator and initial project lead of MapStruct.

Bean Validation and Hibernate Validator::
https://beanvalidation.org/[Bean Validation] is a Java specification which lets you express constraints on object models via annotations.
Originally developed at the JCP, it's now part of the Jakarta EE umbrella at the Eclipse foundation.
I have been the spec lead for Bean Validation 2.0 (JSR 380) and the lead of the reference implementation https://hibernate.org/validator/[Hibernate Validator].

Other Hibernate Projects::
As part of the https://hibernate.org/[Hibernate] team, I've contributed to different projects such as Hibernate OGM (an effort to access NoSQL stores with JPA),
Hibernate Search (full-text search for domain models based on Apache Lucene and Elasticsearch) and Hibernate ORM.
